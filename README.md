### About Me 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Maintaining ecommerce websites I wrote mostly in PHP, working on a general AI project in C++, and developing integrations for both with Web3. Particularly interested in Ether/Solidity and Cardano/Plutus. 

## Experience
First tech stack wasn't so much a stack as a pancake: BASIC on a TRS-80 with state-of-the-art *cassette drive*. Been programming ever since... started using C++ before there was a compiler, when the only thing available for the PC was the Glockenspiel C++ pre-processor (1988). Started Java with beta version .9x in 1995 - actually worked a short time at Sun before they got swallowed by the evil empire. Consulted for lots of Fortune 500, including way too much telephony, doing stints at all the Baby Bells except Nynex. Also a year for the Italian phone company Sip/Sodalia. Worked for my own companies since 2000.

## Claim to Fame
I wrote the first PPC-native graphical C++ class browser, a product called Linnaeus, which was itself written in C++ with MASM for the graphics because PC's were sooooo slow in 1990. Beat the Microserfs by about a decade, for all the good it did me

## What I don't do
Pole dancing, or anything Microsoft.
