### About Me 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
maintaining ecommerce websites I wrote mostly in PHP, working on a general AI project in C++, and developing integrations for both with Web3. Particulary interested in Ether/Solidity and Cardano/Plutus.

## Experience
First tech stack wasn't so uch a stack as a was a pancake: BASIC on a TRS-80 with *cassette drive*! Been programming ever since... started using C++ before there was a compiler, when the only thing available for the PC was the Glockenspiel C++ pre-processor (1988). Started Java with beta version .9x in 1995 - actually worked a short time at Sun before the got swallowed by the evil empire. Worked for my won companies since 2000.

## Claim to Fame
I wrote the first PPC-native graphical C++ class browser, a product called Linnaeus, which was itself written in C++ with MASM for the graphics because PC's were sooooo slow in 1990. Beat the Microserfs by about a decade, for all the good it did me
